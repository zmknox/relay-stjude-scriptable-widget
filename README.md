# relay-stjude-scriptable-widget
A widget made with Scriptable to show the total of Relay FMâ€™s [St. Jude fundraiser](https://stjude.org/relay).

This widget is designed for use with [Scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188).

To install:

- download the Scriptable file included in this repository
- import the file into Scriptable
- add a Medium or Large widget to your home screen
- choose the Relay St. Jude Progress script
- set the widget's parameter if you want to limit the number of milestones shown (1 works well for Medium widgets, while around 3 or 4 work well on a Large widget). You can set this to 0 if you don't want to see any milestones
